KFS TRAINING CONTENT - OCTOBER 2018
=======================

- What to expect here
  - You will NOT know everything
  - Better holistic understanding
  - Better knowledge base about how to find what you need
  - It's gargantuan, built by multiple teams, spanning 15 years
- Overview & Structure
  - 2 systems (kfs & rice)
    - Plus some rice libs included in kfs
      - (open PersistableBusinessObjectBase) and show libs
    - Mostly you can ignore the fact that Rice is remote, except:
      - (show both URLs)
      - Different URL to address rice screens directly
      - Be aware when your rice pages are IFrame'd in the portal
      - Doc Search, Action List, Perms, Roles, DocTypes
  - 4 code projects (ucd-kfs, kfs-baseline, ucd-rice, rice-baseline)
    - Don't put kfs-baseline and rice-baseline in Eclipse
    - grep -R for non-java searches
  - The overlay
    - Why is there org.kuali code in ucd-kfs?
  - The Database(s)
    - 3 schemas (plus others)
    - Naming conventions
    - Snapshots FTW
    - DB schema differences between Local and Deployed environments
- Finding Things in KFS, part 1
  - So many conventions!  learn them use them
  - Expectation Setting:  If you don't already know this, you won't have it all memorized after this training
  - The front-end
    - Portal files
    - JSP vs Tag files
    - javascript & css
  - The Code
    - Struts action & form classes
    - Business object
    - Documents
    - Maintainables
    - Lookup helpers
    - Services
      - SpringContext
      - ServiceLocators
      - When to use SpringContext.getBean vs ServiceLocators
        - Local services use SpringContext, Rice services use Locators
    - Batch Steps
    - Integration points
    - GlobalVariables
      - ThreadLocal
      - Only in batch jobs and API endpoints do you muck with the UserSession
      - You only will run into this with Validations and batch jobs, mostly
  - The XML
    - OJB
      - baseline: ojb-<module>.xml
      - UCD overrides: ojb-<module>-override.xml
      - UCD New: ojb-<module>-uc.xml
    - Spring
      - baseline: spring-<module>.xml (also the module declaration)
      - UCD overrides: spring-<module>-uc.xml
      - UCD TP specific: spring-<module>-uc-tp-only.xml
      - UCD Batch specific: spring-<module>-uc-batch.xml
    - DataDictionary
      - Documents
        - baseline: InternalBillingDocument.xml (from kfs-baseline)
        - UCD overrrides:  InternalBillingDocument.xml (from ucd-kfs)
      - BusinessObjects
        - baseline: Account.xml (from kfs-baseline)
        - UCD overrides Account.xml (from ucd-kfs)
      - MaintenanceDocuments
        - baseline:  AccountMaintenanceDocument.xml (kfs-baseline)
        - UCD override:  AccountMaintenanceDocument.xml (ucd-kfs)
      - Validations
        - Documents
          - baseline:  InternalBillingValidation.xml (from kfs-baseline)
          - UCD overrides:  InternalBillingValidation.xml (from ucd-kfs)
        - MaintenanceDocuments
          - UcKualiAccountRule.java
- Finding Things in KFS, part 2
  - How to find the code from a URL
  - How to find what user I need to backdoor as?
    - Ie, permissions, roles, groups
  - How to find the stacktrace in the logs?
  - How to find the feed files for batch job issues
- Asynchronous Actions & Transaction Boundaries
  - So important it gets its own section
  - Document routing and most actions are synch
    - Immediately return, even before routing is done
  - What this means for Transaction Boundaries
  - Batch Jobs
    - Wrapped Step (giant wrapping transaction)
    - (show examples)
- Struts
  - Intro to Struts
    - Struts isn't scary, it's just old
    - It's a typical early-gen server-side MVC
  - Struts classes are NOT Spring Managed!
  - Actions / methodToCall
  - Forms / document + other fields
    - Buttons / getExtraButtons
  - Important hooks
    - populate()
    - refresh()
  - Document Actions
    - Route, Save, Cancel, Approve, etc
- Validations
  - Transactional document validations
    - Accounting Line validations
    - Validation events
  - Maintenance document validations
- Real World Examples
  - Enhancements
    - Mask a field on a BO
    - Add a new validation on a document
  - Bugs
  - Document exceptions
  - Routing Exceptions
  - Batch Job Failures
- Unit Tests
  - Mocks
  - PowerMocks
  - If you're not sure how something works, write a unit test!
